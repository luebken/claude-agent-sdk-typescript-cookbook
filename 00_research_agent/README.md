Note that Typescript Agent SDK doesn' have equivilant of Pythons ClaudeSDKClient. 

Feature Comparison: TypeScript SDK vs Python ClaudeSDKClient based on https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/python#quick-comparison:

  | Feature             | Python ClaudeSDKClient    | TypeScript query()                               | Supported? |
  |---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
  | Session Persistence | ✅ Reuses same session    | ✅ Via AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>              | ✅ YES     |
  | Multiple Exchanges  | ✅ Multiple query() calls | ✅ Via async generator                            | ✅ YES     |
  | Interrupts          | ✅ Supported              | ✅ query.interrupt() (line 400)                   | ✅ YES     |
  | Hooks               | ✅ Supported              | ✅ hooks option (line 242)                        | ✅ YES     |
  | Custom Tools        | ✅ @tool decorator        | ✅ tool() + createSdkMcpServer() (lines 424, 434) | ✅ YES     |
  | Continue Chat       | ✅ Maintains conversation | ✅ Via async generator + continue option          | ✅ YES     |


The TypeScript SDK doesn't need a separate client class because:

1. Built-in session management: The query() function with AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage> achieves the same goal more elegantly
2. All features available: Interrupts, hooks, and custom tools are all supported through the Query interface and options
3. Simpler API surface: One function (query()) instead of two patterns (query() vs ClaudeSDKClient)
4. Functional style: TypeScript/JavaScript favors functional patterns over class-based OOP

- Integration of multimodal capabilities (text, voice, vision)
- By 2029, predicted to autonomously resolve 80% of customer service issues

### **🎙️ Voice & Conversational Interfaces**
- Sophisticated voice agents that understand tone, sentiment, and urgency
- More natural, conversational interactions replacing traditional interfaces

### **⚖️ Governance & Human Oversight**
- Growing emphasis on security, compliance, and ethical AI governance
- Human oversight remains critical despite increased autonomy
- NIST guidance defining security frameworks for agent systems

### **💼 Enterprise-Ready Frameworks**
- Popular platforms: CrewAI, AutoGen, LangChain, Microsoft Agent Framework
- Focus on enterprise-grade features: observability, durability, compliance
- Built-in tools for monitoring and managing agent behavior

**Bottom line:** 2025 is being called the "year of the AI agent" with the technology maturing from research concepts into production-ready, autonomous systems that can collaborate, reason, and execute complex workflows independently while maintaining appropriate human oversight.

## Key Insights from the Chart Analysis and Research

Based on the chart data and web search findings, here are the main insights about Claude usage patterns:

### 1. **Claude Code's Dominance in Development-Heavy Contexts**
The chart shows Claude Code leading significantly in:
- **Startup Work** (32.9% vs 13.1%) - This aligns with research showing Claude Code's effectiveness for rapid prototyping and MVP development
- **Personal Projects** (36.0% vs 30.2%) - Matches findings that developers prefer Claude Code's terminal-driven automation for personal coding projects

### 2. **Claude.ai's Strength in Learning and Research**
The chart reveals Claude.ai's preference for:
- **Academic Research** (11.9% vs 2.2%)
- **Tutorial/Learning** (12.2% vs 0.7%)
- **Coursework** (4.9% vs 0.4%)

This reflects Claude.ai's versatility as an "all-rounder" study buddy and assistant, with features like larger context windows (200K+ tokens) that can handle extensive documents and complex explanations.

### 3. **Enterprise Equilibrium**
Both platforms show similar usage in **Enterprise Work** (25.9% vs 23.8%), which makes sense given that:
- Enterprise customers often get bundled access to both Claude and Claude Code
- Different enterprise teams use different tools based on their specific needs
- Companies report 2-10x development velocity improvements when using both tools strategically

### 4. **The "Code vs. Chat" Divide**
The data suggests a clear specialization pattern:
- **Claude Code**: Preferred for hands-on development work (startups, personal projects)
- **Claude.ai**: Preferred for knowledge work, learning, and research

This aligns with the research finding that Claude Code excels at "terminal-driven, agentic automation" while Claude.ai serves as a versatile assistant for complex reasoning and explanations.

### 5. **Market Positioning Success**
The chart validates Anthropic's dual-platform strategy, with each tool finding its optimal use cases rather than cannibalizing each other's usage. The research shows this differentiation is intentional and effective for serving different developer workflows.
