Note that Typescript Agent SDK doesn' have equivilant of Pythons ClaudeSDKClient. 

Feature Comparison: TypeScript SDK vs Python ClaudeSDKClient based on https://docs.claude.com/en/api/agent-sdk/python#quick-comparison:

  | Feature             | Python ClaudeSDKClient    | TypeScript query()                               | Supported? |
  |---------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|------------|
  | Session Persistence | ✅ Reuses same session    | ✅ Via AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage>              | ✅ YES     |
  | Multiple Exchanges  | ✅ Multiple query() calls | ✅ Via async generator                            | ✅ YES     |
  | Interrupts          | ✅ Supported              | ✅ query.interrupt() (line 400)                   | ✅ YES     |
  | Hooks               | ✅ Supported              | ✅ hooks option (line 242)                        | ✅ YES     |
  | Custom Tools        | ✅ @tool decorator        | ✅ tool() + createSdkMcpServer() (lines 424, 434) | ✅ YES     |
  | Continue Chat       | ✅ Maintains conversation | ✅ Via async generator + continue option          | ✅ YES     |


The TypeScript SDK doesn't need a separate client class because:

1. Built-in session management: The query() function with AsyncIterable<SDKUserMessage> achieves the same goal more elegantly
2. All features available: Interrupts, hooks, and custom tools are all supported through the Query interface and options
3. Simpler API surface: One function (query()) instead of two patterns (query() vs ClaudeSDKClient)
4. Functional style: TypeScript/JavaScript favors functional patterns over class-based OOP

📝 Final Result:
Based on my research, here's a brief summary of the latest trends in AI agents:

## Key Trends in AI Agents (2024-2025)

### 🚀 **Explosive Market Growth**
- The agentic AI market is projected to grow at 56.1% CAGR, reaching $10.41 billion in 2025
- 99% of enterprise developers are exploring or developing AI agents
- 82% of organizations plan to integrate AI agents by 2026

### 🔄 **Evolution Beyond Chatbots**
- **2024**: Transition from simple chatbots to autonomous agents capable of complex tasks
- **2025**: Expected to be "the year of the agent" with widespread enterprise adoption
- Focus shifting from Q&A interfaces to task-executing autonomous systems

### 🤝 **Multi-Agent Collaboration**
- Rise of multi-agent systems where multiple AI agents work together
- Platforms like OpenAI Swarm and Microsoft's Magentic AI enabling agent orchestration
- True multiagent networks being piloted in late 2024

### 🏢 **Enterprise Integration**
- Major vendors launching agent platforms: Salesforce Agentforce, Microsoft Copilot agents
- 90% of Fortune 500 companies using Microsoft Copilot Studio for AI agents
- Primary applications: email generation, coding, data analysis, customer service

### ⚖️ **Reality Check**
While promising, current limitations include:
- **Accuracy issues**: Current agents resolve only ~14% of real-world coding issues autonomously
- **Trust gap**: Enterprises hesitant to deploy fully autonomous agents
- **Human oversight**: Still required for most complex tasks

### 🔮 **Future Outlook**
- **By 2029**: Predicted to autonomously handle 80% of customer service issues
- **5-10 years**: Expected timeline for autonomous agents to reach full productivity
- **Emerging applications**: Software development, IoT integration, self-healing systems

The consensus is that 2024 established AI agents as viable technology, while 2025 will see broader adoption for specific use cases, though full autonomy remains a longer-term goal.

## Key Insights from Chart Analysis and Research

Based on the chart data and web search findings, here are the main insights:

### **Why Claude Code Dominates Startup Work (32.9% vs 13.1%)**

1. **Professional Development Focus**: Claude Code is specifically designed for serious coding workflows with features like:
   - Direct integration with development environments (VS Code, JetBrains)
   - Ability to see entire project structures and modify codebases
   - Automated testing and GitHub integration
   - Superior performance on complex, multi-file projects

2. **Startup Requirements**: Startups typically need:
   - Production-ready code quality
   - Large codebase management
   - Professional development workflows
   - Enterprise-level debugging and refactoring capabilities

### **Why Claude.ai Leads in Academic Research and Learning**

1. **Accessibility**: Claude.ai's web interface is more beginner-friendly and doesn't require technical setup
2. **Educational Focus**: Better suited for explanations, research, and learning rather than production coding
3. **Broader Use Cases**: More versatile for general research, writing, and analysis tasks beyond coding

### **Personal Projects Balance**

The relatively even split (36% Claude Code vs 30.2% Claude.ai) suggests:
- Personal projects vary widely in complexity
- Some users prefer the simplicity of the web interface
- Others want the advanced capabilities even for personal work

### **Enterprise Work Similarity**

The close percentages (25.9% vs 23.8%) indicate:
- Both tools serve enterprise needs but in different ways                                                                                                             - Choice depends more on specific workflow requirements than general enterprise suitability

This data reflects the fundamental difference: **Claude Code is optimized for professional development workflows**, while **Claude.ai serves as a more accessible, general-purpose AI assistant** that happens to include coding capabilities.
