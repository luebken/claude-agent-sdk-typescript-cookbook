📝 Final Result:
Based on my search through your codebase, here's your current runway situation:

## Current Runway: **20 months** (until September 2025)

### Key Financial Metrics:
- **Cash in Bank**: $10M
- **Monthly Burn Rate**: $500,000
- **Daily Burn Rate**: ~$16,667
- **Quarterly Burn**: $1.5M

### Revenue Context:
- **ARR**: $2.4M (growing 15% MoM)                                                                                                                                                                                   - **120 enterprise customers**
- **Recent Series A**: $10M (closed January 2024)

### Important Considerations:
- You're planning to hire 10 additional engineers in Q2 2024, which will increase your burn rate
- Series B fundraising conversations are underway (targeting $30M)
- There's consideration of acquiring SmartDev Inc for $8M

The 20-month runway provides a healthy buffer, especially with Series B fundraising already in progress. However, the planned hiring and potential acquisition would impact this timeline, so it's good that you're proactively raising funds.

Would you like me to run any specific runway calculations or analyze how the planned changes might affect your timeline?
