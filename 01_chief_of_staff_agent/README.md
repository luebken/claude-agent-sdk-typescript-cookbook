📝 Final Result:
Based on my search of your codebase, here's your current runway situation:

## 📊 Current Runway: **20 months** (until September 2025)

### Key Financial Metrics:
- **Cash in Bank**: $10M
- **Monthly Burn Rate**: $500,000                                                                                                                                     - **Runway Calculation**: $10M ÷ $500K/month = 20 months

### Additional Context:
- **ARR**: $2.4M (growing 15% month-over-month)
- **Series A**: $10M raised in January 2024                                                                                                                           - **Team Size**: 50 employees
- **Revenue per Employee**: $48K

### ⚠️ Important Considerations:
                                                                                                                                                                      1. **Increasing Burn Rate**: You're planning to hire 10 additional engineers in Q2 2024, which will increase your monthly burn rate above $500K

2. **Potential Acquisition**: The $8M SmartDev Inc acquisition under consideration would significantly reduce your runway

3. **Series B Planning**: You're beginning conversations for a $30M Series B round, which is timely given your current runway

### 💡 Recommendations:
- Monitor burn rate closely as you scale the team
- Accelerate Series B fundraising to maintain healthy runway buffer
- Consider the timing of the SmartDev acquisition relative to your funding schedule

Your 20-month runway provides a reasonable buffer, but with planned team expansion and potential acquisitions, securing Series B funding should be a priority for 2024.

📝 Final Result:
Perfect! I found your company's financial information. Based on the data in the CLAUDE.md file, here's your current runway situation:

## Current Runway: **20 months** (until September 2025)

### Key Financial Metrics:
- **Cash in Bank**: $10M
- **Monthly Burn Rate**: $500K
- **Daily Burn Rate**: ~$16,667
- **Quarterly Burn**: $1.5M

### Context:
- You closed your Series A of $10M in January 2024
- With your current burn rate of $500K/month, your runway extends to **September 2025**
- You're generating $2.4M ARR with 15% month-over-month growth
- Your burn-to-revenue ratio shows you're spending about $250K for every $1M in ARR

### Runway Analysis:
This 20-month runway gives you a healthy cushion, especially considering:
1. You're already planning Series B conversations (targeting $30M)
2. Your ARR growth of 15% MoM is strong
3. You have time to optimize burn rate if needed

### Recommendations:
- Begin Series B fundraising 6-9 months before runway depletion (around Q4 2024/Q1 2025)
- Monitor the hiring plan carefully as you're looking to add 10 engineers, which could increase burn rate
- Consider the $8M SmartDev acquisition in context of remaining runway

Would you like me to run more detailed financial projections or analyze how specific decisions (like the hiring plan or acquisition) might impact your runway?
